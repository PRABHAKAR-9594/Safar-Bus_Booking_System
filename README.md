# SAFAR – BUS RESERVATION PORTAL (MERN)

## Overview
This is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) bus booking application. It provides a robust solution for managing bus bookings with various features including secure login, OTP verification, and ticketing. The application aims to offer a seamless experience for users looking to book bus tickets online.

## Features

- **Token-Based Login**: Secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure only authorized users can access certain features.
- **OTP Verification**: Users receive an OTP (One-Time Password) via email for account verification and to secure the login process.
- **Ticketing on Mail**: Tickets are sent to users via email upon successful booking, providing a convenient way to access and manage tickets.
- **Decryption**: Secure decryption of sensitive data for enhanced security.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB server running locally or remotely.
- An email service setup for sending OTPs and tickets (e.g., Nodemailer server).
